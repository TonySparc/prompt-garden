Comprehensive Prompt Structure# Advanced Prompt Engineering Guide for Expression Analysis

This guide provides more sophisticated prompting techniques to get the most detailed and helpful nonverbal communication analysis from AI assistants.

## Comprehensive Prompt Structure

For the most thorough analysis, use this structured prompt:

```
I'd like you to analyze the nonverbal communication in this image:

1. FOCUS: [Specify who to analyze - individual/group/specific person]
2. ELEMENTS: [Specify which elements to analyze - facial expressions/body language/positioning/etc.]
3. CONTEXT: [Provide any relevant context about the situation]
4. DETAIL LEVEL: [Basic overview or detailed analysis]
5. PURPOSE: [Why you need this information - education/social skills/professional development]

Additional instructions:
- Be objective rather than making assumptions
- Note if any expressions seem ambiguous
- Explain cultural variations if relevant
- Mention confidence level for your interpretations
```

## Specialized Analysis Requests

### For Autism-Specific Support
```
As someone with autism spectrum condition, I find it challenging to interpret social cues. Please analyze this image with particular attention to:
- Clear explanation of emotional states shown
- Identification of social norms being displayed
- Explanation of any subtle or mixed signals
- Translation of nonverbal cues into explicit meanings
- How neurotypical people might interpret these expressions
```

### For Professional Settings
```
I'm preparing for an important professional interaction. Please analyze the nonverbal communication in this business setting, focusing on:
- Power dynamics indicated through posture and positioning
- Confidence signals in facial expressions and gestures
- Engagement levels of participants
- Signs of agreement/disagreement beyond verbal communication
- Professional rapport indicators
```

### For Educational Purposes
```
I'm teaching a course on nonverbal communication. Please provide an educational analysis of this image that:
- Identifies specific named expressions and poses
- References established body language concepts
- Explains the physiological aspects of the expressions
- Discusses potential cultural variations
- Provides a teaching framework for these concepts
```

## Tips for Optimal Results

1. **Provide Clear Images**: Higher quality images yield better analysis
2. **Specify Context**: Mention if the image is from a specific cultural background
3. **Be Specific**: Rather than asking for "everything," request specific aspects to analyze
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Start broad, then ask follow-up questions about specific observations
5. **Multiple Perspectives**: Request alternative interpretations for ambiguous expressions

## Response Evaluation Framework

When receiving an analysis, consider:
- Does it acknowledge ambiguity where appropriate?
- Does it avoid making absolute claims about intentions?
- Does it provide cultural context when relevant?
- Does it offer a range of possibilities for interpretation?
- Is it accessible and clearly explained?

Remember that AI analysis is meant to augment human understanding, not replace it. The goal is to provide helpful perspectives while acknowledging the complexity and nuance of human communication.
