# Visual Nonverbal Communication Analysis Prompt

## Overview

This prompt is designed to help AI assistants provide detailed, best-effort analyses of photos with a focus on nonverbal cues. It is particularly useful for individuals with autism or for people who are blind or visually impaired, offering descriptive insights into the facial expressions, body language, and interpersonal interactions visible in a photo.

## Key Features

- **Facial Expression Analysis:** Describes expressions such as smiling, frowning, or subtle microexpressions and suggests possible emotional states or thought processes.
- **Body Language Analysis:** Evaluates postures, gestures, and other physical cues to offer additional insights into how individuals might be feeling.
- **Interaction Analysis for Multiple People:** When a photo contains more than one person, the assistant analyzes the interactions between individuals, noting how their nonverbal cues may interplay.
- **Configurability:** Users can request:
  - Request analysis of a specific individual in the photo.
  - Request a comprehensive analysis of the photo as a whole.
  - Add additional context about the photo
- **Best-Effort Disclaimer:** Clearly notes that the analysis is subjective and should be considered a helpful guide rather than a definitive interpretation.

## Intended Audience

This tool is especially helpful for:
- Individuals with autism who may benefit from explicit descriptions of nonverbal communication.
- People who are blind or visually impaired and require detailed verbal depictions of visual cues.
- Anyone looking to gain a better understanding of nonverbal interactions in photos.

## How to Use

1. **Upload a Photo:** Start by uploading a photo that contains one or multiple people.
2. **Specify Analysis Requirements:** Optionally, indicate whether you want:
   - A detailed analysis of a specific individual (e.g., “Please analyze the person on the right”).
   - An overall analysis of the entire photo.
3. **Receive the Analysis:** The assistant will process the photo and provide a description outlining:
   - The facial expressions and inferred emotions.
   - The observable body language or posture.
   - The interaction between people (if applicable).
4. **Note the Disclaimer:** Remember that this analysis is interpretative and the best effort to provide insight based on visual cues.

## Example Usage Scenarios

- **Individual Analysis:**  
  “Please analyze the facial expression of the person in the blue shirt.”  
  The assistant will then focus on that individual, describing their expression and visible body cues in detail.

- **Group Analysis:**  
  “Can you describe the mood of the group in this photo?”  
  The assistant will provide a comprehensive analysis, describing each person’s nonverbal signals and how they interact collectively.
