# Family Tree Detective: Obituary Analysis Tool
## Overview
The Family Tree Detective is a specialized prompt that turns Claude into a powerful tool for genealogical research through obituary analysis. It helps users systematically extract, organize, and connect family information from multiple obituaries to build a comprehensive family tree database.

## What This Tool Does

- Track confirmed versus inferred relationships
- Maintain sources for all information
- Build complex family trees across multiple generations
- Handle name variants and aliases consistently

## How It Works
The tool follows a structured process:
- Analyze Obituaries: Submit obituary texts to extract relevant information about the deceased and their family members.
- Build Connections: The system identifies potential relationships between individuals in different obituaries.
- Confirm Relationships: You verify which connections are accurate.
- Manual Exploration: Request specific searches or connections within the growing database.
- Regular Summaries: Get overviews of all processed information to track progress.

## Key Features

## Getting Started
